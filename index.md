# About Me

I'm Dhrunal, a senior at Lehigh University majoring in Finance and Business Analytics. I love working with numbers maintaing curiosity, critical thinking, and a deep interest in how data, business, and people intersect. Whether it’s analyzing markets, stocks, or building dashboards. I enjoy projects that bring together the combination of Finance along with data.

# Career Objectives

I’m interested in roles where I can combine finance, analytics, and creative problem-solving — particularly in consulting, investment research, or data strategy. I thrive in fast-paced, high-context environments and enjoy learning new tools, tackling real-world challenges, and collaborating with diverse teams.

# Hobbies

Outside of work, I enjoy stand-up comedy, road trips, and working out. I often go through mini crises about not having enough hobbies and do something spontaneous occasionally, like running a half-marathon with just three weeks of preparation, only to never run again afterward.
