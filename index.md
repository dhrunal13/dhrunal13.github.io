# About Me

I'm Dhrunal, a senior at Lehigh University majoring in Finance and Business Analytics. I enjoy working with numbers while maintaining a strong sense of curiosity and critical thinking. My interests lie at the intersection of finance, data, and human behavior — whether it’s analyzing markets, building dashboards, or exploring the economic implications of emerging technologies.

### [Relationship between Macroeconmic Factors and Dollar strengt](Final Project Summary)
As part of a final project, our team — **The Reddest Bulls** — created an interactive dashboard exploring how U.S. macroeconomic indicators impact the value of the U.S. dollar against major currencies.
We used economic data (inflation, interest rates, trade balances) to forecast USD movements using statistical models, with a dashboard structured around aims, data, visualizations, and predictive tools.

# Career Objectives

I'm interested in roles where I can combine finance, analytics, and creative problem-solving — particularly in consulting, investment research, or data strategy. I thrive in fast-paced, high-context environments and enjoy learning new tools, tackling real-world challenges, and collaborating with diverse teams.

# Hobbies

Outside of work, I enjoy stand-up comedy, road trips, and working out. Occasionally, I go through a “I need more hobbies” crisis and do something spontaneous — like running a half-marathon with three weeks of training... and then never running again. I like pushing myself outside my comfort zone, even if just for the story.
